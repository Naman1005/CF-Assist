> "If you can't <del>measure</del> track it, you can't manage it." - _Some random guy named Naman_

**CF-Assist** is a modern, insight-driven dashboard for Codeforces competitive programmers. It goes beyond the standard profile page to give you actionable data-visualizing your rating progression, identifying your weakest problem tags, and helping you hunt for the perfect practice problems.

## 🧐 Why?

Standard Codeforces profiles are great, but sometimes you need more than just a number. You need to know _why_ your rating isn't moving.

**CF-Assist** answers questions like:

- "Which algorithm tags do I fail the most?"
- "How consistent is my daily practice?"
- "Where are the unrated problems in my difficulty range?"

## ✨ What's in the Box?

### 1. 📊 Deep-Dive Dashboard

Everything you need to know about your current standing, visualized.

- **Rating Progression:** Interactive line charts to track your climb (or fall).
- **Weakest Areas Analysis:** We calculate the failure rate of every tag you've attempted to tell you exactly what to study next.
- **Activity Heatmap:** A GitHub-style contribution graph for your submissions.

### 2. 🎯 Smart Problem Explorer

Stop clicking through pages of problem sets.

- **Granular Filtering:** Filter by **Rating**, **Status** (Solved/Unsolved), and **Tags**.
- **Sorting:** Sort by difficulty to find problems that are "just right" for your current level.
